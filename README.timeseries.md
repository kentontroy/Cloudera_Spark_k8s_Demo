In this demo, a time series depicts the number of crime occurrences in a certain amout of time. <br>
Time series analysis is performed to detect patterns, such as trends and seasonality, of the <br>
crimes over time. <br>

PyStan provides a Python interface to Stan, a package for Bayesian inference.
(streamlit) [centos@cdp src]$ conda install -c anaconda pystan
(streamlit) [centos@cdp src]$ conda install -c conda-forge fbprophet

The format of the timestamps should be YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - see the example csv here. When sub-daily data are used, daily seasonality will automatically be fit.
